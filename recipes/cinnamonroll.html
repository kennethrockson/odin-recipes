<h2>Easy Homemade Cinnamon Roll Recipe</h2>

<p> A delicious and easy way to make cinnamon rolls in the comfort of your own home </p>

<ul>
<li> 1 cup of milk </li>
<li> 1/3 cup of butter </li>
<li> 2 eggs, room temperature </li>
<li> 4 cups bread flour, divided </li>
<li> 1/2 cup white sugar </li>
<li> 2 1/2 teaspoons rapid-rise yeast </li>
<li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
<li> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil </li>
<li> 3/4 cup packed brown sugar </li>
<li> 2 1/2 tablespoon ground cinnamon </li>
<li> 1/3 cup butter, softened </li>
</ul>

<h4> Step 1 </h4>
<o1> Heat milk and 1/3 cup butter together in a microwave-safe container in a microwave on high power for 30 seconds. Stir and repeat until mixture reaches 120 to 130 degrees F (49 to 54 degrees C). If too cool, microwave for 15 seconds more; if too hot, let cool to proper temperature. </o1>

<h4> Step 2 </h4>
<o1> Whisk eggs lightly in a small bowl, adding a small amount of milk mixture at a time to temper eggs until thoroughly combined. Pour mixture into the bowl of an electric stand mixer. </o1>

<h4> Step 3 </h4>
<o1> Mix 3 cups flour, sugar, yeast, and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Add to milk mixture and beat on low speed using a dough hook, scraping down the sides of the bowl using a rubber spatula as needed. </o1>

<h4> Step 4 </h4>
<o1> Add remaining flour slowly, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl. Continue to knead on low speed until dough looks smooth, 7 to 10 minutes; dough will be sticky and the bottom will remain stuck to the bowl. </o1>

<h4> Step 5 </h4>
<o1> Pour vegetable oil over dough and turn to coat. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. </o1>

<h4> Step 6 </h4>
<o1> Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and use your hands to shape into a small rectangle. Roll dough out into a rectangle that is about 1/4-inch thick. </o1>

<h4> Step 7 </h4>
<o1> Mix brown sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl. Spread 1/3 cup softened butter over dough and sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar mixture. Roll dough into a log and cut into 12 equal pieces. </o1>

<h4> Step 8 </h4>
<o1> Place rolls, cut-side down and almost touching, into a greased 9x13-inch pan. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size, 30 to 40 minutes. </o1>

<h4> Step 9 </h4>
<o1> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). </o1>

<h4> Step 10 </h4>
<o1> Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately turn out onto a tray or plate to cool; this allows the inside mixture to drip back into the rolls as they cool. </o1>
